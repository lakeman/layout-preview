This is a simple android applciation that enumerates all of your compiled layouts and allows you to preview them.
To use this simply symlink the res folder from another application into this directory, build and deploy.

The manifest assumes you have a @drawable/ic_launcher and @string/app_name resource. Edit these two properties to match if you have given them different names.
